# urbandict-fun
Playing with urbandictionary API using Go.

Just for some fun, super simple web page to retrieve requested word's definition from urbandictionary.com, then return randomly selected one definition.

Later maybe add html scraper to randomly choose one from newly added words on landing page :p
